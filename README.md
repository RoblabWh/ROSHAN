# ROSHAN
![](ROSHAN_uebersicht.png)
ROSHAN (Rescue Oriented Simulation: Handling and Navigating Fires), is a wildfire simulation tool. ROSHAN integrates the principles of cellular automata with reinforcement learning to simulate wildfire dynamics and automatic handling. entral to this simulation tool is its rendering and simulation of fire spread, achieved by integrating data from the CORINE database. The interactive graphical interface of ROSHAN facilitates real-time monitoring and manipulation of fire scenarios. A key component in ROSHAN is the incorporation of a Reinforcement Learning agent, embodied as a drone, which learns to detect and mitigate fires.

You can read everything about the development [here](paper.pdf).
